            <strong>Global Offensive (CS:GO)</strong> is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve and
            Hidden Path Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two years,
            Global Offensive was released for Windows, macOS, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, and for Linux
            in 2014.
            Valve still regularly updates the game, both with smaller balancing patches and larger content additions.

        <div class="row-sm col-lg text-left">
          <p class=" lh-base text-justify">
            The game pits two teams, <em>Terrorists</em> and <em>Counter-Terrorists</em>, against each other in
            different objective-based game modes.The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while
            Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them, or Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages that the
            Terrorists have captured.
            <br>
            There are eight official game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode. The
            game also has matchmaking support that allows players to play on dedicated Valve servers, in addition to
            community-hosted servers with custom maps and game modes. A battle-royale game-mode, "Danger Zone", was
            introduced in December 2018.

            Global Offensive received positive reviews from critics on release, who praised the game for its gameplay
            and faithfulness to the Counter-Strike series, though it was criticized for some early features and the
            differences between the console and PC versions.
            Since its release, it has drawn in an estimated 11 million players per month, and remains one of the most
            played games on Valve's Steam platform.
            In December 2018, Valve transitioned the game to a free-to-play model, focusing on revenue from cosmetic
            items.

            The game has an active esports scene, continuing the history of international competitive play from previous
            games in the series. Teams compete in professional leagues and tournaments, and Global Offensive is now one
            of the largest global esports.

            <p class="lead cs">The game started as a mod for Half-Life designed by Jess “Cliffe” Cliffe and Minh
              “Gooseman” Le. Valve bought the rights for the mod after that, and the rest is history. Valve, the
              creators of Half-Life, published Counter Strike in 2000, over 20 years ago.Let that sink in for a
              moment.<br>A game that’s 20 years old but still around competing with the biggest names in the gaming
              industry. Back in the days, Counter Strike brought some fresh ideas and revolutionized the whole FPS
              genre. After that, nothing would ever be the same.<br>Others learned from Valve, and thus the FPS genre
              was never the same again. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Failure of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero</h2>
            <p class="lead cs">Condition Zero brought some new features into the game like BOT’s and single-player
              missions but was never a giant leap from the previous version like everybody expected. The main reason for
              the failure was that the game had multiple bugs and often crashed while in the match.<br>The hype
              surrounding the game was huge. The players expected something better from a title that was popular but got
              disappointed with a result. It seems like the developers rushed to make a game to meet the
              deadlines.Condition Zero was later used as an example of what mistakes should get avoided in the next
              titles.<br></p>

            <p class="lead cs">Not so long after, Valve published Source following the failure of Condition Zero. With
              all that they’d learned in the previous release, Source delivered on the promises and brought something
              new to the table.<br>After the previous title’s failure, the players were doubtful whether Valve could
              repeat the first game’s success. Luckily, Valve created a game that’s described as one of the best titles
              in the whole franchise.<br>Some players play Source even today, and there are still servers with the
              hardcore fans. We are still grateful that this game put the franchise back on its feet and helped them to
              continue the good work.</p>

              GO was one of the most expected games in the gaming community, with many hardcore fans waiting for the
              chance of playing it once more.<br>In the beginning, GO had many issues and bugs, which developers had to
              address if the game would have any chance of competing with AAA titles. It took some time, but in the end,
              we got a game that is one of the most competitive FPS on the market today.<br>With the old-school player
              base besides the young generations, Counter Strike is once again at the top of its fame.</p>
